      <description>The purpose of this project is to construct a smart parking lot which can make the parking quicker. Auto- detection of the specifically built signs is adopted to assist the parking. The open source computer vision library, OpenCV2.4, is employed in this project.
Scene ONE: How the driver obtains the location of the parking space?
Solution ONE: The QR-code which represents the unique position of the parking space is stick to the ground.</description>

      <description>DESCRIPTION: The FlapFish 1.0, a concept UUV (Unmanned Underwater Vehicle),is designed for marine geomorphy exploration. It is approximately 0.8m long and 0.2m diameter. The major feature of the FlapFish is that it is propelled by a pair of flapping wings, which can reduce drastically the propeller-induced noise.The motor is under the control of a microcontroller which enables the FlapFish 1.0 to voyage with assigned velocity and direction.
